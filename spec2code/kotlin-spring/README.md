# Generating server code with kotlin-spring

This example showcases the usage of [OpenAPI generator kotlin-spring](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/kotlin-spring/) in a Spring Boot / Kotlin / Gradle application.

Generation is based on an [OpenAPI spec file](src/main/spec/api-spec.yaml).

## Known issues
* Inheritance of DTOs generated by the generator is incorrect.
  * Child-classes of LiteratureDTO are not extending LiteratureDTO, eg. BookDTO.
  * This is a known issue and is tracked [here](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/issues/19928).

## How-to run
```shell
./gradlew bootRun
```

## How-to access auto-generated API documentation
* [HTML-Docu generated by Redocly CLI](http://localhost:7002/docs/api-spec.html)

## How-to test
* use the REST-API with [some example requests](src/test/http/authors.http)
* run all tests:
```shell
./gradlew test
```
